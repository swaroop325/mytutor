I'm super excited to tell you that I just released my first solo book. It's called Talk Python in production. It's the inside look at how we host all the talk Python sites, APIs, and more. The core idea is that I believe most hosting stories sold to developers and data scientists are way over complicated and overpriced. You've heard me say that you're not Google and you're not Facebook. So you shouldn't run your infrastructure the way they do. But if not that, then what? This book is both a blueprint for what I chose at Talk Python and a story arc of 10 years of running our own infrastructure from complete newbie to pretty neat infrastructure as code DevOps style. You'll find the book right on Talk Python.fm, just click book in the navbar. I've made the first third of the book available for free for everyone to read online. After that, you can grab the DRM free ePub and Kindle editions from that same page. I hope this book resonates with you. People have asked me to share the details of how I run our sites at Talk Python and now here it is in detail. If you're interested, grab the ebook at Talk Python.fm today. I'm working on the paperback version as well. Should be out soon. Giddenbook is a great way to support the podcast. Quayne, welcome to Talk Python. Great to have you here. Oh, happy to be here. Yes, I'm happy to have you here. It's going to be a super fun data science topic. You've got a really cool project over at codecut.ai. And one of our listeners reached out and said, you have Quayne on because she's doing amazing stuff over at codecut.ai. And I'm really getting a lot of value out of it. And I'd love to hear more about this project and maybe dive into some of the topics there. So we're going to have a really great time talking about that. But before we get to those, really quick introduction for everyone, who are you? Yeah. Hi, everybody. I'm Quayne Trang. I'm a developer advocate at Nixler. I am also the founder of Codecut, where I share daily tips on both a LinkedIn and my news to my newsletter. And I send out short tips, which have about data science and Python in a form of code snippets that is very easy. So that just in two minutes, three times a week. Three times a week. That's a lot. Yes, it's a lot work. But I have been doing it for four years, I think. So I have been writing writing Python snippets for like basically every day of the week on the weekday for four years. So yeah, very fun. And you also have longer form articles there. Yes, that is correct. I also enjoy writing long form articles that are deeper into open source. So majority of the time, like 95% of the time, I write about open source Python data science related to. So very specific. And I like to really explore how, you know, what, what, what, what is, what should data scientists use this tool? And how they use it. And my assumption for every article is data scientists are very busy. And if they only have found this article, they will, they will be able to get some takeaway from this tool and be able to apply right away. So you will see that as a common theme for stupid, my code snippets as for a newsletter, like very short, very easy to digest, as well as article, even though it's long-form, but also very, like if they want to, they can skim it, guess something out of it or if they really want to let that differ, you can sit down and like call up and ",

And my assumption for every article is data scientists are very busy. And if they only have found this article, they will, they will be able to get some takeaway from this tool and be able to apply right away. So you will see that as a common theme for stupid, my code snippets as for a newsletter, like very short, very easy to digest, as well as article, even though it's long-form, but also very, like if they want to, they can skim it, guess something out of it or if they really want to let that differ, you can sit down and like call up and both will work for getting out of it. Yeah, I agree. I read a bunch of your articles and I think you can certainly get get it a lot, even if you just have only time to skim them. I learned a couple of extra new tools. I think they were going to have a lot of fun to talk about as well. So how do people get your code snippets? Is that through your newsletter or how you do that? Yeah, people get my code snippets to my newsletter and if you go to the front page, see if you buy that looks like, yes, that's how it looks. So this was the audience who's listening. So the form of my newsletter is I would, so I would actually like some specific feature out of the tool, right? Because if them want to can have many features and you don't want to talk about all the features in one code snippet, it will be really difficult to digest. So I picked one feature. I compared with something that people already know. For example, in the screen, we see we are comparing between regular expression, rack X, library and flip and we try, I want to compare something people already know, something that is less and all. So highlight, okay, we will see the typical problem with the tool that people are know and here's a solution and this tool offers the solution and so that's to code snippet. My philosophy when it comes to teaching people is it's better to show than to tell. So I put a lot of effort into making it very easy for people to when they look at the code snippet, they can understand, of course, there's some horny text. So if you scroll down a bit more, so you can see the problem solution. The problem is I'll just read out here, rack X, pre-processing, achieved exact matching but fails completely on typos like iPhone 14 Pro with like two double R max. Delusion, if you're providing laterally scoring the tolerace typos and character variations in aboling approximate matching where rack X, and they can be the full article of F1 but yeah, that's cool. Need to be digested with the newsletter. Yeah, I think you could, you could probably read that and get a good bit of information on that in like one minute. That's really nice. And the idea you're highlighting here is like sure you can search if you're doing data science, text and LP type of stuff. If you search with regular expressions, you might find things, but what if the spacing is different between them or somebody puts a comma or they put iPhone 14 without a space between the 14 and the iPhone, right? Like all those things are really tricky to catch every variation. So there's better tools like Difflib, which we'll probably talk about again later in an article, right? And in the article, I highlight a lot more to, so it's from like rack X to D Flip, and then if you want to like even mirror, then fuzzy matching, right? And then if even you want semantic capture, a capture, and there's another tool. And then of course, you can go down all the the spacey route and into LLMs and like the whole spectrum, right? But just knowing about this, because sometimes you don't, you don't want full machine learning, you just kind of like regular expressions, but not so hard. That's correct. Like something that get the job done to me is the I need to is something that is like works right out the box without a lot of moral playtical and not too many dependencies. Yeah, that's really really important. So let's talk about the origins of codecut.ai. Why did you start it? So I started when I was in college, so for you, so I started to I didn't start the website, so I start sharing my tips first. I started on LinkedIn, right? So I make a commitment to myself that I'm going to, so I initially I write a lot of articles and I push out two to three articles on closed data science every week. And I met the commitment, I want to do that every week. And then I, but I was not very active on LinkedIn, and then I read a book called Share Your Work, and it's a, how, know that how messy your work is, you should just share it. And I was very into open source tools, and I often, you know, just set a message to my friend, say, hey, like check this out, this is so cool. And I would want, if I could share it with more people. So I started to, you know, put out some of the things that I excited about on LinkedIn. And initially, I was so afraid, people were like, what were you talking about? You don't know what you're talking about. But people also were excited about it. And I was like, oh, great, I shared something I was excited about, and I didn't have some other people, and everybody excited about the tool. I love that. So I keep doing it. Initially, I do it like every day. So seven days per week, share every day later. I was like, okay, I'll be myself the weekend off. But I started to do, I think over 500 tips. And then people was like, where can I find the old one? Because if you want to, let's say, if you are new, interesting in machine learning tools or data processing tools, how do you find on LinkedIn is there's no way for you to categorize. So I started to go back to most of my, it's, it's so many. So I'm sure as many as they can put it into a website. So it was at the time, I just filed like some domain, it commas data simplified. And then I just put a bunch there and then I sent out some newsletter. So very, very not polished at all. And I just want to have a place to capture. And then later I figured out that people was a lot of time people do type type, or when they type, because it's very long, um, you know, so I try to make it something very short and actually capture what I would do in coca. So it'd become coca. Yeah, I like the aesthetic of it. It looks nice. It's got this, these soft warm colors. Thank you. Yeah, I try to, you know, keep everything kind of like a cotton candy. So like blue and pink. Yeah, it does, yeah, cotton candy definitely comes through. I can see that for sure. What platform did you use to build it? I use WordPress. But I, so for articles, I am creating a workflow where basically I write on my articles in, you know, portal like doc Q. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I realized that so I write and also like run my code in portal. And then I use a WordPress API to push it to my article in blog. So I do a lot through like I, it's create like it's easier than I don't use a WordPress editor to create the article. I use BS code to Q and B. But for the aesthetic, why I like a press because I can like drag and drop. And I'm not a front end developer. Well, it works well. Yeah. You know, it's interesting. I think a lot of people who are developers get hung up feeling like they have to create their website in the same language or technology that they're expert in. You know, if like if you're a Python developer, you're like, well, how do I create a website and Python for my blog or, you know, whatever language, right? But I think there's a lot of value and just saying like it's just a tool. I'm just going to pick it and it's going to be great. Like for, for example, I had for a long time, I had my stuff in WordPress under my own domain for my blog and other things. And I finally decided to move on to Hugo. But Hugo is also not go. I think it's really, you know, it's good if you know the technology, but it's certainly not something I think people should get overly hung up on because you can you lose out on good tools that way, right? Yeah, exactly. And I mean, you can learn like you can learn any language, right? If you know one language, you can learn to kind of guessing another. It's that it's especially now with AI. Yeah. That's such an interesting topic. I do think that's actually really changed a lot of things. It's like, well, I could work with this, but it's I know I'll get stuck on something and it'll be a pro. And now you can just ask an agent like AI like I'm stuck on this. It's okay. Here you go. You know, and even if it's not perfect, it really, really helps handle juggle different types of technology. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Super cool. So tell me more about this quarter thing. I didn't intend to talk about this, but I find it really interesting. Do you write in markdown? Do you write HTML? What do you write in and then publish? Yeah. Okay. So I write in Quanto. It is in markdown, right? Talk to somebody else. Because you know, it's in markdown, but it's basically really similar to dog MD. The only difference is you can execute the code. So I can, so my really favorite stack is in VS code. I have Quanto on the left side. And then I can, I have I open a doc QMD file. People can just imagine it's like a doc MD file, but you can click the button and you can execute. So it's very similar to a notebook, right? But I like it. I really enjoy writing in markdown. And it's just like a very clean, right? Compared to a notebook, it's a bit QMD. You think can think of like a markdown just markdown and you can execute the code. And this and then go after I have the image, I have the code, everything. I will, so I create some Python functions to clean it up a bit. No, like for example, if the, that's some cell that I, I roll, I don't want to show it on WordPress on my website. I will say, echo is false, right? It's just like a comment, Python comment on the top of the cell, as you're not sure in the, in the website, she's great. And then I can just run publish to work press and it's public to work press. What is nice about it is let's say later, some of the content is, I want to change, let's say, in three articles, I mentioned something, like a link to something, but now it's broken. So what I can do is I can just like, you know, click search by all the instances of it update it and then I run the function sync to work press. And then it will sync, right? And hey, like I don't read to manually go through each of it to, yeah, that's really nice. And it'll just fix all the articles that need to be changed. Yeah, okay. This portion of talk Python is brought to you by century. Over at talk Python, century has been incredibly valuable for tracking down errors in our web apps, our mobile apps, and other code that we run. I've told you the story how more than once I've learned that a user was encountering a bug through century and then fix the bug and let them know it was fixed before they contacted me. That's pretty incredible. Let me walk you through the few simple steps that you need to add error monitoring and distributed tracing to your Python web app. Let's imagine we have a flash app with a react friend end and we want to make sure there are no errors during the checkout process for some e-commerce page. I don't know about you, but anytime money and payments are involved, I always get a little nervous writing code. We start by simply instrumenting the checkout flow to do that. You enabled distributed tracing and error monitoring in both your flask back end and your react front end. Next, we want to make sure that you have enough context that the front end and back end actions can be correlated into a single request. So we enrich a century span with data context. In your react checkout.jsx, you'd wrap the submit handler in a century start span call. Then it's time to see the request live in a dashboard. We build a real-time century dashboard. You spin up one using span metrics to track key attributes like cart size, checkout duration, so on, giving you one pain for both performance and error data. That's it. When an error happens, you open the error on century and you get end to end request data and error trace backs to easily spot what's going on. If your app and customers matter to you, you definitely want to set up century like we have here at Talk Python. Visit talkpython.fm-century and use the code Talk Python, all caps, just one word. That's talkpython.fm-century-code-talkpython. Thank you to Century for supporting the show. Notebooks are awesome and the idea of notebooks are, you know, they really changed the game, I think, a lot. But you don't necessarily want to see all of that when your goal is mostly writing, right? Like, you don't necessarily need to see all the import statements if you're only going to focus on one cell worth of code and it's not about the import, right? Right, especially when my goal is to make it as easy as possible for data scientists to skip. And you know, when you skip it, you see like, on block of code, you're like, okay, I skip, I'm done. Like, I'll read this the next time, but my goal is always very small, cold-sleep, and highlight the core features of the tool. And a lot of times, like, you need to hide the unnecessary code, right? You know, for that to happen. Yeah, yeah, I totally agree. People can get hung up on completeness and it really takes away from the essence of just like skimming it. And also, I think that this workflow, it sounds like this is one of the things that made it possible for you to do this frequently, like, three, four times a week instead of getting overwhelmed, right? Yeah, I really need to learn so many tricks in order to, I guess it's a good thing, right? It pushed me to be more productive, like, I learned a bunch of short cuts because, you know, without short cuts, I cannot get things done quickly. So I know a lot of these cold short cuts. And like, I use a tech expansion tool. It's called Expanso, and it's damn-chancho. I can like, you know, like, view the code this article, right? If you can just call and dock something, something, like two words, and then expand the whole text. And then you can view in the black. Yeah, I need to learn multiple tricks and also, like, just all the main things is how I can get it out. But, yeah, what I still find is, so my doing that, I can actually focus on the essence of the block, which is to make it as easy as possible to digest as well as researching, which is very important for you. Yeah, absolutely. I love your philosophy here. I can see why the site is popular. And, you know, the show you work, I think that's a great philosophy as well. It's like, get it out there, even if it's messy and get it out there, even if it's incomplete, right? That's the idea. Yeah, exactly. And I really do recommend it for especially people who try to find job, right? At the time, I kind of like another side effect of it is, you show your people what you know, because I, very, so many people, they know a lot, but they don't share, right? And if you said, you know, employers to fight you by guessing what you know or look at your resume, it's very hard because everyone now with AR, everybody have very polished, very nice resume. So why should they choose you over another person? But my show on your work, by showing like even the messy one, right? They will be able to see, okay, you see, what they're interested in? You see, what met them started about? And you see what they know? Then they will be able to imagine how they can use you in their company. And that's how, because of me sharing my articles as well as LinkedIn polls early on, when I was in college, I was able to get multiple internships in data science. Yeah, super neat. And you know, you're in developed relations. And I think there's a strong communication aspect of that as well. Yeah. This is just another example of like, yeah, you want to hire me for this thing? I'm already doing it, right? Like what are my first important jobs I got? I was doing a lot of speaking at user groups and meetups. They weren't called meetups then because meetup.com didn't exist. But, you know, they were me, they were meetups. And I got a message from a company and they said, hey, we saw you're talking at this place in that place. And you're doing that for free. We'd pay you do. If you want to do this for a job and like, great. What do I sign up for? I didn't even have to apply. They just reached out to me. And the timing was perfect because I had quit my long time job a week before. And I'm like, okay, well, I was about to start looking for a new job. But I guess you look for a new job after you quit your job. That's very, very, very, what you like intended to take a break or something? No, I was not as brave as it sounded. My wife got her PhD and finished. And she was getting her first professor job on the other side of the country. And so I was like, well, I'll wait till we get there and look for a job because it was, you know, San Diego to New Jersey level of travel. It was far, right? So I figured I'll find something there. I see. And then you've got a new job. Yeah, I think I quit my job, but I was still working for a month, you know, because I knew I was going to be moving in a while. And so I'm like, okay, guys, I'm leaving in a month, six weeks or whatever. And about that time, people reached out. So it was a perfect, perfect deal. I see. But just like you said, it's because of the stuff I was doing out in public, right? Right. Yeah. Okay. So let's dive in. Let's dive into code cut here. And the idea I thought is maybe we could just go through a handful of articles. We picked 10. I don't know how much time we have to go through all of them. We probably can get through all of them. But I think the sook of people and idea of what they can get from code cut. But also I just think there's a bunch of interesting data science ideas and tools. Yeah. I'm going to like that diplib that we talked about. So I think it'll be a good blend of that type of stuff to talk about. So let's start with an article called goodbye pip and poetry. Why UV might be all that you need. So tell us about this and then we can dive in diving a bit. Yeah. So I think a lot of people have heard of UV, which is like a dependency management tool. But let me for people who don't know about it, just kind of give some quick reason why UV is maybe something that you want to look into. So a lot of data scientists know Konda and no people. I think poetry is a little bit less common. But for why a poetry is like a more modern tool that allows you to do is manage so many things. A dependency management and virtual environment. And you can attend or anyway. So there's a lot of things in poetry. But UV is something that I didn't like about poetry is pretty slow for dependency management. But when it comes to UV is quick, like it replace many things. And even if you are using pip, you don't want to learn new tools. Basically, you can just use UV pip install. Something something and you have a speak boost. And it's yeah. So I grow and type I don't go about UV. And I also compared with the existing tools so that to give people some motivation on switching it to UV. It's so easy to switch. So why not? Yeah, I think I am a huge fan of UV. Actually, just interviewed Charlie Marsh for his next project, PYX. Oh, why? Two days ago. Yeah. So UV is going to get even better. Yeah, I just pulled up just the performance story. For UV compared to poetry and pip sink. And yeah, it's what is that 20 times faster than poetry and way faster than everything else? And so yeah, it's a rust because of the rust. I think rust. And then also they they just rethought the caching and other they just it's rust plus a bunch of new ideas that came together to make it work really, really well. And honestly, I feel a little bit I feel a little bit bad for the other tools like I'm a big fan of pip tools and pip X. Mm-hmm. Me too. And you know, those things are really great. And we'll come back and talk about them a bit, I think as well. But I think those tools laid the foundation for what UV is doing. And UV, you know, sort of naturally brought these together. But I whenever I think of the contributors and maintainers of those projects, I feel a little bit bad because they're not getting as much love as they used to. But they're still I get excited about new tools right quickly. And I don't often think about how the maintainers at the old days, the tools at last popular think. So I think it's the natural way of things, I think. But it's also it's also tough. So the speed is important. One thing I think is interesting. And while I think this is especially interesting for data science and you touched on this already is in the I come more from like the web API side of Python, I would say. And over there, it's been pip all day long, right? It's been pip the whole time. But in the data science side, it's really largely been conda and a conda distributions, that kind of thing, conda environments. There's been kind of this separate separation. And obviously, those are all pulling from the same projects. They're all on GitHub and so on. But like there has been a little bit of a difference. And I feel like UV is made a really big splash in data science and kind of bringing those two worlds back together. What do you think? Yeah, I agree. I actually have an article long time ago. I think it's probably in co-cuts too. It's called peep versus conda was poetry. Well, yeah, I was trying to give a very fair comparison. I was in favor of poetry. But you know, I I campaigned everything. And something that I had to be on, I was not a fan of conda. And after the comparison, I was not even more of a fan of conda because I felt it's very heavy. Like you can use anything mini conda so it quicker. But at the same time, it install many dependencies that you didn't ask for. So it's kind of like a solution where you have a lot of dependencies out of the box, right? But I find that a lot of time you didn't ask for some dependencies and installs. So you don't really have control over what being installed as well as the way that it's solved dependencies are not. I find it is very slow. But with so so poetry is worse, better because you know, it's cleaner. You can see like what you put in. You can see like all everything in a file. Like there's a separate file, right? One for one is what? Pie project dot Tom and one is a long. One is the other sub dependencies. And now a UV is to me is like that, but to like like poetry, but better. The fact that it can run very fast. So one drawback of poetry was sometime is think very hard about and take a long time to solve install new dependencies. And also UV replace X. You know, like it kind of like a all in one place tool, which is I think very necessary, especially for everybody who use Python, but for data scientists, you know, they already have so many things going on and to them to learn, you know, good practices. You know, the less they want to upgrade, right? From Python 3.5 to 3.6, 3.7, you know, use all the tools in order to do it. It seems like a lot. If you can just use one tool and then you can run it, like upgrading in one command line, then we're not. Yeah, 100%. I think it's great. And it has a lot of compatibility with previous workflows. For example, you can use UV pip install instead of using its project management thing, like with ad and sync, right? Like so you don't necessarily have to adopt its style. You can just say instead of pip install, you can say UV pip install. One of the things that used to bother me and I don't I honestly just have it looked for a while about Honda was coming from a non data science side. Some of the libraries safe, like requests or flask or something like that. Yeah. Pyramid they those were held back quite a bit because you know, they try to make sure there's a like a compatibility between the versions that they shipped to your conda, which is I think that's good for like data science reproducibility. But when it comes to web frameworks, you've got to be super on top of updates in case there's a security vulnerability. You know, you want to release that thing the day the vulnerability is announced. You want to upgrade your website because sooner this announced, people start scanning the internet for any website that could possibly be susceptible to that problem, right? And so like the web tools were held back a lot. So that's one of the reasons I never really embrace conda. Yeah. Another, not that you mentioned it. Another I also found it is one thing that I didn't like about Honda is you know, like there's less data scientists like pandas, right? If this pandas version is available, then a lot of time like sometimes it's not not available on conda. That's one thing. But another thing is data scientists collaborate with other engineers. Right. So as someone they need to hand over to the engineers like machine learning engineers, data engineers, right? And I think in my previous company, like they were like they didn't use conda. So to them to like need to install conda or there's a way for you to and from conda to pip. But then like 30 pandas is look very messy and it's not like like a one-to-one translation sometime is not you don't get the same environment. Sure interesting. Not the trouble for handing over, right? And that's a reproducible is a big thing when it comes to data science. So and dependencies play a big part of it. So if you make it hard to reproduce the dependencies, then there will be some bugs. There will be some errors and even world silent errors. This portion to talk pythonymy is brought to you by agency. Build the future of multi-agent software with agency spelled agntsy. Now an open source Linux foundation project agency is building the internet of agents. Think of it as a collaboration layer where AI agents can discover, connect and work across any framework. Here's what that means for developers. The core pieces engineers need to deploy multi agent systems now belong to everyone who builds on agency. You get robust identity and access management. So every agent is authenticated and trusted before interacts. You get open standardized tools for agent discovery, clean protocols for agent to agent communication and modular components that let you compose scalable workflows instead of wiring up brittle glue code. Agency is not a walled garden. You'll be contributing alongside developers from Cisco Dell technologies, Google Cloud, Oracle, Red Hat and more than 75 supporting companies. The goal is simple. Build the next generation of AI infrastructure together in the open so agents can cooperate across tools, vendors and runtimes. Agency is dropping code, specs and services with no strings attached.

Thank you as always to agency for supporting talkpython.fm. Next article. Let's talk about. I think this is a big one. Reproducibility, maintainability, that kind of thing. What you talked about there was kind of a good lead into it. It's like the production engineers need to make sure that what they're running runs the same as what the data side does have tested and come up with. The situation is different. The runtime environment is different. Maybe it's going to give different answers because of different versions or something. Yeah, exactly. And dependency is a big thing, but there's also other things that come into it. We can talk about it too. What are some of the core ideas of reproducibility? So reproducibility, I think. At the heart of reproducibility, you want to let's say, especially for data scientists, when they create code, the right, great machine learning models, when it packages dependencies, also depends on parameters that you use. You use everything the same from experiment to experiment. It can produce slightly different accuracy. So you want to be able to, let's say, one data scientist say, I got a 0.9 accuracy. Then they give it, head it over to their teammate to deploy. And then it's great in the performance. It's no longer have a 0.9 accuracy. It can be, you know, without 0.8. And so reproducibility is very important in terms of, you know, you want people, if you produce some results, you want other people to be able to reproduce the same results so that your company can profit out of it. But another thing is trust, right? Let's say if you made a center, you create something that is good, but then you hand it over and it's bad, then it reduces the trust from your co-workers. The third thing about is, let's say if they just create some project and then later they want to reuse it, right? For another project, they cannot reproduce the same results. They then need to, then it's kind of like, you need to throw it away, creating everything from scratch. So it also time consuming. And another big thing after producing it, I think go ahead in hand is maintainability. But yeah, you can go ahead. Yeah. No, I totally agree. The maintainability part is super important as well. And so what are some of the pieces that go into that? I mean, the first thing that comes to mind for me is pinning your dependencies either through using something like UV in it, UV add, UV sync, or just a requirements.txt file or pinning your requirements, you know, through some other means like with poetry, but somehow clearly documenting what's used. I think it can be easy for data scientists to just import some things in a notebook and then do a magic, well, UV pip install that right here and let's just keep going. But then like, why won't it run later, you know? Yeah, are you talking about maintainability or reproducibility? Well, I was thinking maintainability. I love it. But both, yeah. So maintainability, another thing is, another aspect that comes into maintainability is readability, right? And I think this is a big thing for data scientists. A lot of data scientists don't write readable code and modular code. What you will see is like a big chunk of code with like nested if else or using global variables inside a function or not using function or and that's a lot of duplicate in the code. And I mean, that is great for quick experimentation. Like you want to get something out of it. But at the same time, it's create a lot of technical debt in terms of that's a useful thing. That reach to not readable, right? So read it and I can go deeper. I just want to listen out readability and then reproducibility. Like and readability, you want your code to be readable because there's scientists collaborate with other engineers. And if you're cold and also the another problem I saw is data scientists, they cannot read the old code in like a couple months. They forgot. They won't provide. They're really like, what do I write and they spend quite a bit of time to understand what they write. And if they cannot understand or they don't trust it, right? If you don't understand in a full level, you cannot trust it and you cannot use the next project. A lot of times it writes things from scratch again. So readability also, if the code is not right and well, readability and reproducibility, you cannot, it's harder to reproduce the same result because there's a global variables. You global variables and it affects your code. Then it's hard. You might introduce some external factors that make the code different the next time you run. So mentee really is very important and that comes with sorry, right, readable code, version control, dependencies management, configuration management, meaning no one hard code the values into your code. Yeah, this is a really great article here because it shows you so many tools and techniques, I think. Yeah, thank you. And I also so mentee writing a maintainable data science project has been my passion for a long period of time and it actually has become a book like this. This is an article from but I also recently wrote a book about this. Finish a book about this is called production ready data science. Yeah, congratulations. That's that's amazing. When when did you finish it? When did you publish it? Two months ago, I think. Okay, so really recently, yeah, very recently, I took me quite a while like I have other materials because I've been writing about this. So like I have so many materials who had put it together and also make it less in like an article style, explaining more of the why before the hell is also what I focus a lot on this book. Yeah, that's a super important part. Now I you know, I am a huge fan of thinking a lot about readability and spending a lot of time on readability and I I agree with you. I think you're we're on the same page for sure on that one because if your code is not readable, that doesn't mean it can't be read it, which is made as harder to read, right? If your code is not readable, it it's harder to maintain it. It's harder to see the bugs, it's harder to read. All the things that you've pointed out and I think it's a little bit ironic that the notebook style of development that is meant to communicate like it's it's supposed to be more communication compared to regular programming, right? It's got it's got the mark down cells, it's got the pictures, it's got little tables for like df.head, that kind of stuff, right? It's natural way of programming it leads to less maintainable reusable code, right? Because it does not encourage functions. So like it's really hard to do reuse if you don't think, oh, maybe I need to write a function in this cell, collapse the cell and then use the function later, right? That's not a that happens, but not very much. I was doing some research for just looking around really research is a little bit high, putting a high position compared to what it was. I was looking around for some examples and I found this really cool JPL collection of notebooks for studying, I think, glass, I think galaxies, like studying the brightness of galaxies and trying to understand things about them and they had a bunch of cool notebooks in there and they were like a thousand five hundred lines of code and stuff in there, one function, one. Wow. Oh my god. That is probably, I mean, maybe this is necessary, but it's probably not necessary and this is JPL, right? This is like a polished, published thing, not just a random notebook, a rana cross, right? The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which is, I consider them to be pretty amazing. So maybe speak through a little bit about that, like this maintainability thing in Juck's position with like notebook style. Yeah, definitely. I, that's the thing I, before I, I think five years ago, I wrote an articles that got very popular, but also a lot of controversy is called, I think something about seven reasons, why I switched from a notebook to Python script, something. But so anyway, so the thing about notebook is a lot of people argue, yeah, you can write functions, it's just Python, you can write function, you can write whatever you want, just like a Python script, but the interactive style of it can kind of discourage you from doing it. Why should I write a function when I can just see the result and then I build upon it, because in notebook, what is so great about it is you can see the result and then you can build upon it in the next cell, next cell, next cell. So people are less likely to build a function, which like if you create a function, then like it's high inside a function, it's not as to kill the code. So that's one thing, another thing problematic about notebook is it's encouraged hard coding, you know, like love time, because if you want to see the result, you want to put your value in there to see the result. Another thing is, or a very big problem is cell execution, right? If you execute cell, the fact that it gives you the ability to execute in different orders is nice, but also a disadvantage in a way that if you run it in the wrong order, yeah, then it will like you get like some can get some result right now that is different from the result that you want to run. Right, if you forget to run a particular cell, you go back up, run that to refresh anything, you skip back down. Something in the middle was important and you don't rerun it, that's that's probably not good. Yeah, exactly, and that's I remember when I worked in notebook before, it just gave me a headache because I would run something as I, oh, did I rerun? Like did I run that score? Or did I not? Just to make sure I'll rerun it. So it's something and then later when I come back to a notebook, I was like, I'm not going to reuse this notebook again because I don't know what's going on here. Yeah, I don't want to people to think that I'm completely anti notebook. I'm not, but I do think that there are some techniques and some tips that you can use. So when I was riffing on functions, one thing I think you could do, and you touched on it as well, is you could take the parts of your code that you want to reuse and put that in a Python script next to your notebook and import it, right? And then you can use it. A lot of times I think there's a bunch of cells in notebooks that don't really have to do with the presentation or the important part. They're just there like, well, I need to load this thing or I need to like clean up that or something. And it has to go before what you actually want to show people. You could put that in a script. Yeah. And you could just show import it and then show the important part. Right. It's more readable, more reusable. It's more modular. Like in all ways, almost it's better. Yes. I agree. I do think about, yeah, it's like notebook is great. It's very good for presentation. But I think the problem is a lot of times people use it more than what is supposed to be designed for, which is, I mean, it's prototype, right? It's to showcase something. It's to showcase it with either non-technical or technical people. It's not used for like everything. And I think that's a problem like a lot of. There's answers used for everything including writing production, writing code. And again, that's another argument, right? Like can you should do production, writing code, in notebook and Netflix did that Netflix create production, ready code in notebooks. And that's great. Paper mill and all that stuff. Yeah. Yeah. The technology is allowed you to do it. I feel like it's still. But at the time, it's a tool that if you use the right, then it will serve you. Yeah. It's interesting. Speaking of tools, I know you've written about, talked a little bit about Marimo. What do you think about that? I think this is a really interesting one. I just did a sort of, I did a course called Just Enough Python and it's software engineering for data scientists. Nice. And I was trying to think. Yeah. And it's like, okay, a lot of themes that you talk about as well, like you should probably learn and get. You know, and so on. But one of the things I really struggled with was I really wanted to use Marimo as the foundation, but you know, 90% or more data scientists use Jupiter. So I ended up using Jupiter, but I think Marimo actually might be a little bit better in terms of software engineering and a little bit better in terms of what this order of operations you talked about, like, because Marimo tracks like, hey, this cell depends upon that cell. So if you rerun this one, we got to rerun that one first. It'll catch those kind of things. But you want to maybe talk about this real quick, because I know you wrote about it a little bit. Yeah. I, I really like Marimo. I think it's great. It has been so I was actually in the middle of writing the book right. And I know data scientists love notebook. And I don't want it to be like, hey, let's just write Python script, but at the same time, I really think that notebook is really hard to grab production ready call. And that's, you know, my book is about production ready call. So how do you find the media example between, you know, interactive volume of notebook and production ready call. So Marimo came out and I deeply put into it. It solve a lot of problems. And first is a cell execution order. Right. So the problem in notebook is let's say you cell one, say two, three, you change something in cell one, for example, you are running, but then you change something in cell one. If you forgot to rerun cell three, then, you know, the result is not going to reflect one, you have change in cell one, but with Marimo, it can detect the dependencies. And if you, you change me cell one and cell three, depending on cell one, depending on the variable in cell one, then it will execute it automatically, which is great. Another big thing is, you know, notebook, not this advantage, notebook is at least JavaScript, right. So it's very big, unreadable, hard to if you want to use it or hand it over reuse it. It's really hard. Right. It's when you try to pull a new version just because the output has changed and that shouldn't even be taken into account. Right. And yeah, that shouldn't be taken into account. And also the ads will can be big, but with Marimo, so Marimo, notebook is just a Python script under the hood. So you have you have, and what great thing about Python script is you can reuse it. You can like import it in another Python script, but also for CI City, right. That does, and you can write unit tests, you know, like with unit tests are important, but with in notebook, you can write unit tests that's hacker, hacker, out, but it's a hack. And and uptime people need to put their tests inside notebook, which is not not module, right. It's not, it's make it very messy with code and then test inside the same place. But like if you write notebook that is Python script under the hood, then you can write unit tests and you can run it with pites. Yeah, very cool. I think this is a thing, I generally wanted to use it, but I'm like, but at the same time, I probably got to speak the same language of the people doing doing that. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Another thing I want to talk about here, I mean, this actually this maintainability article has just got so much good stuff in it. Something I think that might be new to folks is Hydra, right. Let's talk about this idea of managing configuration files with Hydra. Yeah. I love Hydra. So Hydra is developed by Facebook research and I think I use it. It has been my two gold. So I have some portals. I go back for every data size budget and Hydra is one of them. Something that, so for, I guess if you think about Hydra is a configuration management tool, you can write your configuration inside a YAMO file and then you can, you know, like call things, you can access the variables inside the YAMO file inside Python script. That is not new, right. People know about like there's a YAMO muting library in Python that allows you to work with YAMO, but something I, something I like about how to unlock is reduce the model plate code. So you can just add a app like a decorator to your Python function and then it will be able to access everything underneath inside the Python function and instead of using a brackets notation, like for example, if to access a nested value, you might need to use mutable nested function, but instead you can use dot notation, which is very clear. Other things are, or you can, as your project getting bigger, right. I mean, for a small project, maybe a YAMO is enough, that's your project getting bigger. Let's say you have, you want to be able to use, especially in like, data science experimentation, you want to use different values, you want to experiment with different way of processing, you want to experiment with different parameters for your models, and that can get messy, your YAMO file becomes very big. So a good way to handle this is you want to get into smaller configuration, but if you want to do that without like, Kaira, then you need to write Python functions to access it to to to to come positive to to put it together, put the business a puzzle together. With Kaira, you can basically everything is handled for you. So you can rack it apart and then you can refer to different parts of the business. You can like in one YAMO file, you can refer to the other part of the YAMO file, it's got like an important Python, and you can override it for another thing I realized, you can override the parameter from the command line. Yeah, that's a cool feature. Yeah, so you don't need to go back into the, because a lot of time, you want to experiment with different parameters, or inside the production environment, and the development environment, you might use different parameters, and if you can override from the command line, which is used a lot in different platforms, then that will be amazing. Yeah, it's super neat. Basically, provide a bunch of default values instead of hard coding them, and then if you need to override them, you can do that through the command line, or you could just do it in code, or whatever, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, excellent. And you bring it all together here in your article, UV run process. Yeah. So you got your hydra, you got your UV run, Kevin, together, all that stuff. So you actually have a whole article. I originally started talking about it because it was in the maintainability section, but you have a whole article called hydra for Python configuration, right? That the article is more like a high level, but then I have smaller articles that talk about each tool. Super. Okay, well, we're not making very good progress through this, but that's okay. Because these are really interesting topics. Another one that you talk a lot about is doing proper logging. And you recommend Log Guru, which I love Log Guru. I think it's really great. I use Log book for a long time from Armin Ronecker. But then I've been slowly moving towards Log Guru. Nice. Yeah, I really like so another thing about, you know, like a lot of data scientists that use print, which nothing wrong with print. Like in fact, you shouldn't use, I think it's overkill. You use printing on notebook, right? But when it comes to like if you want to rub production ready code, if you have a bunch of prints because of time you had debugging prints, right? And if yeah, you can go back and like delete them and everything, but wouldn't it be great? But then like if you go back to development environment, then you need to like put it back. Or if you don't do it at all, if you keep all the print inside your code, you're going to development. Now you have a bunch of noise when you see the output. So with logging, just a simple way of you think it about, I think a big advantage of logging is you can do logging and you can use different more like debug info, warning error. So you can set the level based on you can show like this, say if you're going to your development environment, you want to show the debug level, if you're going to do the production environment, then you might want to do like the info level only. But one drawback of logging is I think it's tech a lot, a boilerplate code. That's the first thing. So it really, even if you can pop in place, even it's like a one barrier, you know, like a one barrier to use logging. Why should I do all of these code when I can just use print? It's got like you got to register hand and all sorts of funky stuff. But what if you can have a advantage of print, like so easy to use and the benefit of logging, then that's why I'm such a big fan of blogger rule, which have the mess up both world and other things that it allows is beautiful app the box. So the the login output it looks colorful, it's very easy to see with a standard logging you need to do a lot of, you know, you what do you want to show? You want to show this, you want to show the lies of code, you want to show the function where the output is coming from all those configurations with log rule, you can just say from log rule import logger and then logger docked in far something something and the output is very beautiful. Yeah, I really like it. You can basically just, if you wanted to like kind of keep your print style, you don't have to you can just import it and use it in its prints, right? Yeah. The other thing like you pointed out this is a super big for people who are primarily data scientists who haven't worked with logging a lot or new programming, instead of just saying logger print, you say logger debugger, logger info or logger error, and then you can say production just show me the errors or hey, something's going wrong, actually show me show me all the warnings and the info and you can dial it up and down without changing the code. So you can leave your effective print statements there and just turn them off with a configuration, maybe with hydra, who knows? Yeah. Yeah, really nice. And the color. And the color is very nice as well. It's very colorful. Yeah, it's in the color it persists through files, by the way, right? So if you have logger logging to a file and then you tail the file in your terminal, you see the color still, which is awesome. Oh, wow. I need to know that. That's a new component. Yeah, yeah. Because some of my stuff is all logging with logger and I tail in the color comes through and it's so much easier. Like, for example, on the website, one of the things that I'm logging to a separate file is what are the requests? What is the response time? What is the status code? Is it a 500? Is it 200? Is it a three? You know, whatever, right? Oh, that. And so I'll actually have it change the color based on what happens. So if the message is a 500, it's a different color than if it's a 200 or if the response time is over 500 milliseconds, it changes color to like a warning sign versus under like in it, all that stuff comes through and it's like so nice with logger. Nice. Yeah, especially when you have a lot of logs and that is very useful. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, Git. Let's talk about source control. Yeah, version control is I think is huge. It's very useful and it's very important for data scientists, but I don't see it's being used enough. I was in, yeah, in the last time I actually, I was a machine learning engineer in Accenture and working with clients. So I was building kind of like a data science environment data science tool that integrated with say AWS SageMaker and it's funny how many data scientists are not using it and like their multiple data science team and they want to communicate with each other. You know, they want to share their work, but then every time they want to share their work, it's just have a source version control which surprised me, you know, it's a big client. It's a big one of the use Git and if they do, it's not very good practices. So that's why I want to educate the scientists more about Git. And to me, yeah, Git is so important for several reasons. But let's say if you do something, you mess up some code. Let me give an example of data scientists. They produce, they write a model, and they write code that produces a model that works great. Then like later, they want to just a parameter, maybe experiment with different type of processing, see if the model performance can increase and the method is the model decreases in performance and they have added two or three files. Now they need to okay, what did I add now need to revert it? And if you don't have a, you don't already like save the last version that was working, you cannot just revert to it, right? But with Git, you can, there's multiple things. If you just a solo data scientist, then you can revert it to the last working version. But if you work with all the data scientists, then you can share, you can also collaborate with them. Like different data scientists can work on different versions. And then as they all different features, and when they ready for it to be published, then they can merge it together. Which is so much better when you do it with Git that, might like gone last two lives. I think I agree with you. I think data science, data scientists don't use source control, virtual control enough. And I think that even when people work alone on their own project, they should use, they should use Git or something else. And honestly, they should just use Git these days because it's the the lingua franca of everything that people are doing, you know what? But it lets you, it lets you do exactly what you're talking about. And it's not just, oh no, I have to go back. But I think a really important part, people, you know, speaking to the people who don't really use it that much, or they only use it in their professional settings in the team, maybe. I think it lets you be fearless in exploring new ideas. Right? Like, all right, I'm going to commit this version. And then let me just terrorize my code. Like try something crazy. And oh my gosh, it worked. Great. We'll keep it. If it doesn't work, nothing lost. You can 100% go back. And if people don't, if they're not, they mean that's a good reason even by yourself, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. And it's, I feel like it's so easy. You can do Git Edge commit that, I mean, there's a lot of thing you can do with Git, but I think to just learn some basic Git Edge commit git push, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it's not, you don't have to learn, there's maybe five or six commands you got to learn. Mostly your tools that you're working with, you mentioned VS code, it's got awesome Git. Oh yeah, I am. Integration and I charm and others. Yeah, absolutely. I think that's really, really nice. Let me give you two more ideas and see how these land with you, okay? Or why I think Git is now more important than ever. Yeah. Number one, if you're doing any agentic coding, here's another reason to use like a proper editor instead of a notebook as well potentially. But you can go and say, Hey, AI agent, I would like you to change this and add this feature and do this thing. And it'll just go and go for, you know, 10, 15 minutes. If what I find a lot of times with these agentic coding things is they make great progress. You're like, wow, this is amazing. It makes more great projects like how is this even possible? I live in the future. And then the next step is, oh, no, it broke it all. You know what I mean? So yeah, yeah, you have the same experience. Yes, and I love that you go into this topic because that's kind of I think of the best practices I have been mentioned. It's more important than ever now that you have AI. You're working with AI because two different things, right? A lot of time, you want it to do something and then it broke. So you want to go back to the previous version. That's one thing. Another thing is if you commit very frequently, then you can see what it changed. And you can get it before you commit it or you push because so many, I think it's so frequently that I, I saw it do something that is not optimal for multiple nested like with AI, a lot of time, it overcomplicates the solution. It makes it so many try exact accept and if else and all it used is hard code, it just made practices. But with if you if you control, you use version control, you can see like the difference like the last call and the new call and you can catch it before you commit. And yeah, yeah, it's one important than ever. I 100, yeah, you're 100% right. You're right on it. I find that when I'm doing the agentic coding side of things, I actually have the source control tab open in my editor, not the files tab, but the source control. And as it's going, I'll see what files are changed and I'll start like looking at the diffs. Even while it's still working, I'm like, oh, it's on a good path. Oh, no, it shouldn't be doing this. And either you ask it to fix it or you just go, no, I'm reverting it. Yeah, I added a feature to the website. Not a super big one, but kind of touched a lot of files. I think there was 15 commits to achieve that change because every time a major, I'm like, okay, the AI's gotten something right. I'm like, save that to get. Yes. Take because it's it's like exactly like you described. It's awesome. Yeah, I it's feeling the same like I would have so many commits for like one feature change because also something that I tell to do is, you know, just let's say if I want to implement like something I really like to do is go very thoroughly with like planning very, very thoroughly in advance before I even code to ensure like everything is what I expected. And then I let it run, right? And what I did depends on what I wrote. I do what recently I tried develop like a workflow to go from, you know, my code into newsletter. So I wanted to implement something. And I want to be I want to be able to walk away and go back and be able to go back to each. So I break into phases like let's say I break into five phases, right? The the easiest phase and the more complicated phase like the nicer have feature. Now I want to go back into each phase and see if it breaks. I want to know when it breaks. So I for every phase, I said to commit so that you know, if I want to, if it breaks somewhere, I can go back to the previous version, which also nothing, then you can ask it to commit while it's cool. Yeah, yeah, that's interesting. I haven't thought about asking it to commit. That's cool. I'll give you one final reason to use Git in the agentic world. And then I think we're out of time. I'm going to have to call it. In fact, this has been a great conversation. I one other thing you talked about like, oh, it's made good progress and then something didn't work. And you can actually tell it. You you gave your example, let me make this more concrete. You gave your example of, oh, I made some changes as forget the AI, right? I made some changes. It turns out that the performance fell apart. I edited three files. I couldn't quite remember what was wrong. Yeah, you could go to an agentic AI and say, please look at my Git local Git history from this commit forward and try to understand why the performance fell apart. And I bet you it will have some really good ideas if not know exactly why. And it can just it will do what we described for us in reverse. Like it'll just look at the Git history and go, this changes, this change. Oh, if this change, I bet it had this effect. And then right, so you can leverage it in reverse and feed it to the AI to get understanding to. Yeah, yeah, that's such a great use. Okay. That you just talk about a lot of time. You're like, okay, use Git. Look at the difference and tell me what's wrong. That's such a, that's another thing that I use very often. Also another thing on top of it is let's say it doesn't code the way you like everybody have the old pre-first style to do things, right? So sometimes you can you can edit it and you tell it, okay, look at the your implementation and my implementation and like just kind of take notes of the difference. So that like the next time it will be able to create similar, more similar to the style you're looking for. Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea. I feel like we honestly could talk about this for hours, but we're out of time. We're out of time, Quint. So thank you for being here. I think let's leave it with this. Let's leave it with two things. First of all, maybe final call action, people are interested in code cut AI, all of the stuff you've created. How do they get started with all of your resources? Yeah, so just go to my website code cut. So C-O-D-E, C-U-T, dot AI and then you will see how to sign up for newsletter. There also a book tab that if you want to, if you're interested in production, ready data science, you can buy it there is currently on sales, it's Labor Day week. So 20% off and yeah, that's it, that's and if you want to rig my blog, go to blog. If you want to see a sample of my co-snip-bit, go to short posts. Everything is very easy to navigate. Just go to dot AI. Fantastic. All right, well thank you so much for being here and sharing all your experience and your work. Really, congratulations on C-O-D-Cut. It's a cool project.
