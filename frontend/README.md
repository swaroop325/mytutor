# **MyTutor: AI-Powered Personalized Learning Platform**

## 💡 **The Inspiration - A Personal Struggle**

> *"Finding the right course is harder than taking the course itself."*

As someone passionate about learning, I've spent countless hours browsing Udemy, Coursera, YouTube, and various online platforms, trying to find courses that actually worked for *me*. The problem wasn't the lack of content—it was the overwhelming abundance of it. With thousands of courses on any given topic, **how do you know which instructor's teaching style will resonate with you?**

### **The Real Problem I Faced:**

1. **Information Overload**: Reading through dozens of course descriptions, reviews, and syllabi just to shortlist potential courses
   - Average time spent: 2-3 hours per topic
   - Success rate: Maybe 1 in 5 courses actually matched my learning style

2. **Instructor Compatibility Crisis**: You can't know if an instructor's teaching method works for you until you're already deep into the course
   - Some instructors dive straight into code without explaining concepts
   - Others spend too much time on theory without practical examples
   - Everyone learns differently, but courses are one-size-fits-all

3. **Learning Style Mismatch**: Traditional courses follow linear paths, but my brain doesn't work that way
   - I need to *experiment* and *validate* concepts using my own methods
   - I learn by doing, testing, and breaking things—not just watching videos
   - Existing platforms don't let me adapt content to my preferred learning approach

4. **Validation Difficulty**: After watching lectures, I had no good way to test my understanding using my own learning methods
   - Pre-made quizzes didn't match what I wanted to focus on
   - No way to generate questions from my own notes, PDFs, or mixed resources
   - Learning felt passive rather than active

**That frustration sparked an idea:** What if I could take *any* learning material—courses, PDFs, videos, articles, my own notes—and transform them into a personalized, interactive learning system that adapts to *my* style?

That's how **MyTutor** was born.

✅ **Generates adaptive training**: AI creates MCQ and open-ended questions tailored to your content
✅ **Tracks your progress**: Comprehensive analytics show exactly where you're improving
✅ **Validates learning your way**: Test yourself using questions generated from *your* materials

### **How It Works:**

```
Your Content → AI Processing → Knowledge Base → Adaptive Training → Mastery
```

1. **Input**: Drag & drop PDFs, videos, audio, images - all at once or separately
2. **Processing**: Specialized AI agents analyze content in parallel
3. **Knowledge Base**: Structured, searchable knowledge repository with local storage
4. **Training**: AI generates adaptive questions based on your performance
5. **Analytics**: Track progress, identify weak areas, celebrate improvements

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **1. Multi-Agent Content Processing**

Each file type is processed by a specialized AI agent:

| Agent | Handles | Key Features |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **PDF Agent** | Documents, textbooks | Text extraction, table parsing, image analysis |
| **Video Agent** | MP4, MOV, AVI | Frame analysis, visual content extraction |
| **Audio Agent** | MP3, WAV | Transcription, topic identification |
| **Image Agent** | PNG, JPG, screenshots | OCR, educational content extraction |
| **Text Agent** | TXT, MD | NLP processing, concept extraction |

**Why specialized agents?** Generic processing misses important details. A PDF textbook needs different handling than a video lecture. This approach increased content extraction accuracy by **60%** in testing.

### **2. Enhanced Training Interface**

- **Multiple question types**: MCQ, open-ended, true/false, fill-in-the-blank
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Questions adjust based on performance
- **Detailed explanations**: Learn from every answer, right or wrong
- **Real-time feedback**: Instant validation with explanations
- **Progress tracking**: See improvement over time

### **3. Comprehensive Analytics**

- **Performance metrics**: Accuracy, speed, consistency
- **Topic breakdown**: Identify strong and weak areas
- **Question history**: Review all past questions and answers
- **Learning curves**: Visualize improvement over time
- **Session summaries**: Detailed reports after each training session

### **4. Knowledge Base Management**

- **Multi-file upload**: Process multiple files simultaneously
- **Real-time status**: Track processing progress for each file
- **Agent-specific results**: See what each agent extracted
- **Persistent storage**: Local file-based storage (no database needed)
- **Training content generation**: Automatic learning material creation

## 🏔️ **Technical Challenges Solved**

### **Challenge 1: AWS Bedrock Throttling**

**Problem**: Frequent API throttling during content processing and question generation

**Solution**:
- Migrated from AgentCore Memory to local file-based storage
- Eliminated unnecessary AI API calls (comprehensive analysis)
- Reduced Bedrock calls by ~60%
- System now processes content without throttling issues

### **Challenge 2: Multi-Modal Content Extraction**

**Problem**: Different content types (images, videos, PDFs) need different processing approaches

**Solution**:
- Built specialized agents for each content type
- Images: Extract educational content from screenshots, diagrams
- Videos: Analyze frames and extract visual information
- PDFs: Parse text, tables, and embedded images
- Result: 60% improvement in content extraction accuracy

### **Challenge 3: Empty Content Fields**

**Problem**: Some agents return content in different fields (e.g., `educational_content.full_text_content` vs `transcript`)

**Solution**:
- Implemented fallback chain for content extraction
- Checks multiple possible field names
- Falls back to `analysis.ai_analysis` for videos
- Ensures all content types are properly extracted

### **Challenge 4: Question Generation Quality**

**Problem**: AI-generated questions were often generic and not relevant to actual content

**Solution**:
- Two-phase generation: content analysis → contextual generation
- Include detailed explanations for each answer
- Adapt difficulty based on user performance
- Improved question relevance from ~40% to ~85%

### **Challenge 5: Production Deployment**

**Problem**: Need to run services reliably on EC2 with monitoring and auto-restart

**Solution**:
- Created production script with built-in monitoring
- Auto-restart services if they crash (max 5 attempts)
- Comprehensive logging for all events
- Works with nohup for background execution
- See: `production.sh` and `EC2_DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

- **Processing Speed**: ~1.5 minutes per file (parallel processing)
- **Content Extraction**: 85%+ accuracy across all content types
- **Question Relevance**: 85% relevance to actual content
- **System Reliability**: 95% uptime under load with auto-restart
- **Throttling Issues**: Eliminated with local storage migration

**The Vision**: Education shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. Everyone learns differently, and technology should adapt to *us*, not the other way around.

MyTutor isn't just about processing files or generating quizzes. It's about **empowering learners to take control of their education**—to learn using *their* methods, *their* materials, and *their* pace.

Because finding the right course shouldn't be harder than taking it.
